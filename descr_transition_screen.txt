;	The quote, translation, and quoted are now labels into a localised text file
;   If you add new quotes, then the labels should be added to data/descr_quotes_lookup.txt", 
;   and the strings added to data/text/quotes.txt
;
;   All the old 'labels' have been kept in the format here as it was easier, but in general
;	labels should contain only the characters a-z, A-Z and '_', '"' will be ignored and any 
;   other characters will be changed to an underscore during text lookup
