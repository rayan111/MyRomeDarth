;; This file contains descriptions used for the fonts in the game.
;;
;; The syntax is simple, the keyword 'font' is followed by a size specify (from any in the list below), 
;; followed by the filename of the font (this file must be in the data/fonts directory), followed by
;; a size (in pixels I think).  The keyword 'kerned' can optionally be used at the end of a line to 
;; specify that that font should always be rendered with kerning enabled.  Some fonts look better with kerning,
;; some without
;;
;; Fonts used should generally be truetype 1 fonts, although some truetype 2 fonts work.  The easiest
;; Thing to do is suck it and see
;;
;; The fonts currently recognised by the game are: tnr, tnr_med, tnr_sml, verdana, verdana_med, verdana_sml
